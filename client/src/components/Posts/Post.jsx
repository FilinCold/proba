            'emerged after the invention of the first printing press in Europe. ' +
            'Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type and used it to produce different compositions. ' +
            'His workshop could print up to 240 impressions per hour. Until then, the books were being' +
            'copied by hand. All the books were handwritten and decorated with hand drawn ornaments and' +
            'figures. A process of copying a book was long but each book, even a copy, was a work of art.</p>' +
            '<p class="text__class">The first printed books were, at first, perceived as inferior to the handwritten ones. ' +
            'They were smaller and cheaper to produce. Movable type provided the printers with flexibility' +
            'that allowed them to print books in languages other than Latin. Gill describes the transition' +
            'to industrialism as something that people needed and wanted. Something similar happened after' +
            'the first printed books emerged. People wanted books in a language they understood and they wanted' +
            'books they could take wuth them. The were hungry for knowledge and printed books satisfied this hunger</p>' +
